        Sir Isaac Newton (1642â€“1727) was an English physicist and mathematician
        who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time.
        He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the foundation
        for classical mechanics. Newton also made significant contributions to optics and
        developed calculus independently around the same time as Leibniz.
